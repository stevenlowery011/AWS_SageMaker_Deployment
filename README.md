# SageMaker Deployment Project

The goal of this project is to construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. A recurrent neural network model is constructed using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, the model will be deployed via SageMaker and a simple web app will interact with the deployed model.
